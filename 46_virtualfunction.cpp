// A virtual function (also known as virtual methods) is a member
// function that is declared within a base class and is re-defined 
// (overridden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class 
// object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call
// a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s 
// version of the method.
